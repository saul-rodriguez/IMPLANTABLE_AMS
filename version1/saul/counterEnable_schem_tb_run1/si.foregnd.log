INFO (VLOGNET-187): While generating an explicit netlist, it is recommended to
set the Terminal SyncUp option on the Netlist Setup form as 'Merge All' with
this option.
Alternatively, you can set the hnlVerilogTermSyncUp variable as
'mergeAll'. This helps in generating a pure explicit netlist.

INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the

"/afs/kth.se/home/s/a/saul/projects/IMPLANTABLE_AMS/version1/saul/counterEnable_schem_tb_run1/testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name mapped
table, set 
simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or the
.simrc file 
before invoking Verilog netlister.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating
instance ports. To prevent 
them from being printed, set
simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist
Configuration list. 
If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be
re-netlisted in the 
list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either
in CIW or the 
.simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to
"z". To get inout 
pins with initial state of "0", set
hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
either in CIW or the .simrc file.
 
INFO (VLOGNET-117): Re-netlisting the entire design.
